This is a basic To-Do List web application built with Flask and SQLite. It allows users to add new tasks, update existing ones, delete tasks, and manage their daily activities in a simple interface. The project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a lightweight backend and can be used as a starting point for learning Flask and database integration.
